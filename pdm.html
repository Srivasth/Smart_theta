    <p><strong>P</strong>redictive analytics is a bright light bulb powered by your idea.</p>
    <p>You can never have too much insight. The more you see, the better decisions you make, and you never want to be in the dark.You want to see
    what lies ahead,<strong>preferably before others do</strong>. It's like playing the game "Let's Make a Deal" where you have to choose the door
    with hidden prize. And the biggest challenge is all the doors look same. So it's just your best guess which depends on your luck.</p>
    <p>But what if you had an edge -- the ability to see through the keyhole?.</p>
    <p><strong>Predictive Analytics</strong> can give you that edge.</p>
    
    <div id="case"><h3>CASE STUDY</h3></div>
    <p>Assume you want to maintain constant pressure in a certain container. You have control of a valve that can pump more air into it, or release some air. It sounds like a simple task: if the pressure is below the target, pump some more air in, and if it’s above the target, release some — that should do it. Months pass, and your valve accumulates wear and tear: but you notice nothing, because your controller is doing its job, keeping the pressure constant — even if that means pumping a little more air each week to offset a small leak in the + connection between the valve and the container. But the damage accumulates, and one day, something goes ‘crack’ inside the valve, imperceptibly. No warning. The container loses pressure, the failure cascades downstream with critical systems failing, one after the other. Red alerts sound, the floor manager orders ‘all systems down’ until the fault is diagnosed. The culprit is identified: it was the valve. 
The new valve cost you less than 100 dollars, but the downtime set you back a million. Wouldn’t it be nice to have had some advance warning?
This is the promise of Predictive Maintenance: early warnings for critical failures to avoid downtime.</p>

<p>The <strong> PREDICIoT</strong> will be a one stop solution to all your maintenance and downtime problems. We will help find the appropriate data and make things happen. 
  This help your industry as a whole or a machine to function in virtually zero down time.</p>

<p><strong><div id="topic">Data collection</div></strong> - Sensors implemented in machines gather data on the machine and its environment</p>
<p><strong><div id="topic">Feature Extraction and Reduction</div></strong> - Elements for measuring are chosen and extracted -for example, temperature levels or motor rotation speed.</p>
<p><strong><div id="topic">Model creation</div></strong> - An algorithm runs all the data multiple times in a learning model and the model with its data is tested against the real world variables or ‘output’that manufacturers are testing for - for example, alarms when the system stops working.</p>
<p><strong><div id="topic">Deployment</div></strong> - The model is deployed,the discrepant behavior is relayed back to the model to improve the system’s future
performance</p>.
