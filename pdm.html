    <p><h2>P</h2>redictive analytics is a bright light bulb powered by your idea.</p>
    <p>You can never have too much insight. The more you see, the better decisions you make, and you never want to be in the dark.You want to see
    what lies ahead,<strong>preferably before others do</strong>. It's like playing the game "Let's Make a Deal" where you have to choose the door
